\section{Evaluation of Improvements}
	\subsection{"Performance improvements"}
	% CPU after cri3, 
	% one exemplary case where the previous CRI would get stuck but the new one will not
	% example mario: still to fast to keep up
	% Memory for one test case with exactly equal conditions.
	
	% Comparison for test cast TestForExactPerformance: CRI vs RxFiddle
		% although RxFiddle does not have performance issues (lags > 1 s) for ~ 1000 updates on Chrome (63.0.3239.132 (64-Bit)) with win10 8GB RAM i7 7500 2.7GHz 4CPUs. It does block Firefox (57.0.4 (64-bit)) for a few seconds. Once the UI is build it is noticeable slower than for applications with less value changes but delays < 1s. The CRI performance for this test app is slightly faster, but due to it being an extension instead of a webpage the performance difference may not be due to the tool implementations. CRI generates ~ 2700 steps, RxFiddle generates ~ 1000 values for each operator/observable in the chain of "intervalObservable".
		% CRI is not testable in Firefox
	
	\subsection{"Test Applications"}
	Specifications
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The dependency graph is shown and all observables that are assigned to a named variable are displayed distinctively.
		(Test: The first five named observables in the code are all displayed with an orange background.)
		\item The history of the dependency graph can be navigated. It is possible to navigate to the previous, succeeding or a random step in the history. (Test: Jump to the median step, click next five times, click previous five times. )
		\item For each node, no space is occupied by fields that hold no value in neither the node itself nor it's tooltip.
		\item The ids of the nodes start at one and are continuous. If the test application is started again with the exact same inputs, the each node has the same id as in the last execution.
		\item The source code tooltips show and highlight the corresponding lines of code. (Test: If possible, choose two nodes, one that corresponds to the middle of a chain of reactive function calls and one that corresponds to the end of a chain of reactive function calls. For both nodes check if the highlighting is correct.)
		\item The node or edge that was updated in a step is highlighted. (Test: Check for the first ten steps in the history.)
		\item The history queries can be used to search for a specific event in the history. (Test: evaluationYielded and nodeUpdated find the corresponding steps for the first named node.)
		\item Reactive breakpoints can be used to pause the debugger when a specific event occurs. (Test: A breakpoint set for the first node created will break at step one. A breakpoint for the first node updated will break before the value is shown in the CRI)
		\item The graph can be searched, the matching node(s) is/are highlighted and if the search is reseted the original view will be restored. (Test: Search for the dependencies of a node and then reset the search.)

	% > to use test apps with "broken by policy" host them on the integrated webstorm webserver like http://localhost:63342/chrome-reactive-inspector-3/TestApplications/RxJs/previous_applications/12_movie_search/autocomplete.html note that you need to uncheck "Allow unsecure requests" for it to work properly. The project must be opened in webstorm for it to work.
