\section{Evaluation of Improvements}
	\subsection{"Performance improvements"}
	% CPU after cri3, 
	% one exemplary case where the previous CRI would get stuck but the new one will not
	% example mario: still to fast to keep up
	% Memory for one test case with exactly equal conditions.
	
	\subsection{"Specifications"}
	% for all:
	% - After loading the website, the extension shows the dependency graph.
	% - Each node that does not have a code preview, has a faded border.
	% - All fields are only displayed if they have a value. 
	% - The node Ids are continuous and start with 1.
	% - No console errors while using the test application.
	% - Starting at step 20 the user can navigate to 0 and back to 20 and see the same dependency graph again.
	% for one: (because to much work for all)
	% - for all nodes with a variable name, the code preview shows the first assignment of that variable with an observable.
	% - Search/Dependencies: all dependencies are correctly highlighted and restored once the search is reset.
	% #- Creating a breakpoint for nodeCreated for a node and reloading will halt the execution once the node is created.
	
	%instead of auto testing, provide auto input for all testapps that require input?
