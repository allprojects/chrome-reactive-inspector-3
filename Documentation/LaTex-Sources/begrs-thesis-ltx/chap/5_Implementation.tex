\subsection{Special Environment/Circumstances}
	% shared context through "new Function" that breaks the separation enforced by chrome (previous code eval)
	% async message passing and option handling
	
\subsection{User Interface}
	% bootstrap vs flex-css
	% throttling and debounce = performance
	
\subsection{Source Information Tooltips}
	% limited capabilities of used jalangi -> developed for a special demo, not in general
	% jalangi extension via shallow copy
	% tipsy.js
	% link source to specific js file
	% for developers: find instrumented file - added sourcemap

\subsection{Graph History}
	% what it is, what it contains
	% Performance improvements via paging and delta encoding
	% -> the saving has to be very fast
	% highlighting the current item
	
\subsection{Maintainability}
	% encapsulation
	% reorganizing file structure to match placement in chrome devtools vs other posibilities
	% smaller files
	% testapps page
	% build project
