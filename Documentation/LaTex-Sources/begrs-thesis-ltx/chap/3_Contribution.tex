\section{Advancing the User Interface}
	% present Issue and Solution for each of these:

	\subsection{Reducing the cognitive load on the user}
	% - remove "error" color from normal workflow to decrease cognitive load on the used. Red is associated with errors, warnings and dangers e.g. in traffic especially with high contrast (green). The user should immediately be able to identify the change, but the changed node does not require the full attention over, we therefore moved from using red with high contrast that may even be probelematic for color blind users to an equally destinguishable but less demanding color sheme using blue and orange with less contrast. For this complementary colors to a base color were used.
	% - detect difference between one step and the next (what changed?) -> node (already there) and edge highlighting
	% - usage frequency of input elements -> Reset, Download and Pause/Resume Recording moved to menu. Download currently hiddedn because a change in Chrome broke the used library Simg.
	% reload was added as a button, because it was already part of the usuall workflow by pressing CTRL F5. The ususal workflow would be to create a breakpoint for dependencyCreated or nodeCreated, and then reloading the applicaiton to actually hit the breakpoint.
	%- find node that has specific criteria -> removed unexpressive labels with no data to reduced text to read, to presenting more details and reference to "linking source" that will follow. It also prevents the UI to be clattered by new details that may be added in the future that are not present for every node - an example of this that already existed would be "method".
	
	\subsection{Additional changes to the User-Interface}
	% - starting on a new application or different part of the application -> auto reload after instrumented files have changed
	% - just examine the result -> button to hide query tools - especially usefull when working with smaller screens or bigger graphs.
	% - searching for problems, examining the dependency graph history in detail is implemented in the default workflow and used in many scenarios also directly tied to the dependency graph -> detect odd behavior, jump to desired point of interest;  mention that this is the reason for not relocating
	% - checking specific node is mostly useful for big dependency graphs and therefore not for small ones. Therefore it could be hidden in a closable panel or only temporarily opened if the user clicks a button or presses CTRL F like in many IDEs. It was not moved, because on normal resolutions the space that it occupies would currently be empty. If another feature is added in the future that is more embedded in the default workflow it should replace the search feature in the UI  -> find node or dependents (already there)
	
\section{Connecting abstract graph with JavaScript code}
	% goal: to porvide nodes without a name with additonal details that allows to put them into context. Connect the abstract representation with the code to allow developer to see the code responsible for an issue they detected - was possible before with line information. The developer should be able to easily switch between source code inspection and dependency graph inspection, because not all issues can be found in either of them when used alone. E.g. there is an issue in a lambda function - the developer can not find this issue directly in the dependency graph, he can only see the result in node values that do not match the values expected with the original intention of the code. To fix the issue the dev has to switch to the code anyway so he already has to use both representations in tandem. 
	% Difficulties: 
		% The JS code that is used during runtime is instrumented. Jalangi instrumented code is very hard to read as is shown in listing \ref{lst:Instrumented}. This makes it unfeasable to directly show it to the user. in addition it is an implementation detail of CRI and should not be disclosed. Additionally the code position retrieved from the Jalangi analysis corresponds to the position in the original source code without the instumentation code.
		% The JS code that is used during runtime is dynamically loaded and therefore can not be navigated to out of the box with the Chrome DevTools navigation API. Although this can be mitigated by adding "//# sourceURL=" and a custom url to the bottom of the scripts. Since this shows the Jalangi instrumented source code that is not useful for a normal user, we decided to tie this to a new option called "CRI Developer Mode" that can be enabled in the options page of CRI.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption={Example of RxJS code.},label={lst:Instrumented}]
	$sonWallet = J$.W(593, '$sonWallet', J$.F(585, J$.I(typeof $ === 'undefined' ? $ = J$.R(569, '$', undefined, true, true) : $ = J$.R(569, '$', $, true, true)), false)(J$.T(577, '#wallet-son', 21, false)), J$.I(typeof $sonWallet === 'undefined' ? undefined : $sonWallet), true, true);
	$fatherWallet = J$.W(625, '$fatherWallet', J$.F(617, J$.I(typeof $ === 'undefined' ? $ = J$.R(601, '$', undefined, true, true) : $ = J$.R(601, '$', $, true, true)), false)(J$.T(609, '#wallet-father', 21, false)), J$.I(typeof $fatherWallet === 'undefined' ? undefined : $fatherWallet), true, true);
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	
	
	\subsection{"Possible Solutions"}
	% Navigating to source code via Chrome debug api or open in another IDE
		% It is easily possible to navigate to a line number in a file, if the actual file url (can difffer due to many factors) is known. For the reasons explained above, navigating to the instrumented code is not desirable. A not instrumentated version seems to exist in chromes code storage as dynamic script, but it does not correspond to the script that is used at runtime and any breakpoint added by the user would be ignored since the code is never actually run - this may confuse the user.
		% Pro: 
			% the user can profit from Chromes syntax highlighting and search which supports regex.
			% full code available
		% Con:
			% Leaving context of CRI - user has to navigate between DevTools tabs and looses focus each time. 
			% - Really cumbersome if many nodes are to be inspected. 
			% - unprecise, just the line number is not precise for chained calls.
			% - if navigating with chrome devtools: breakpoints will show but never trigger which could confuse the user
			% most features of Chrome debugger wont work and there is no way to indicate which ones do work to the user. E.g. direct evaluation code (except for pure code like a mathmatical formula since no variables actually contain a value), breakpoints and watches wont work.
			% if another IDE is used "Go to declaration" is probably availabe which provides scaleable query features not provided by a simple string search. Enterprise size applications may return to many results for a string query to be usefull.
	% Opening the code in a simple file viewer
		% Open the file in a popup or using an additional view e.g. a tab in the CRI to display the full code.
		% pro: 
			% full code can be provided - multiple files can be shown
			% it is possible to implement syntax highlighting based on context
			% it is possible, although cumbersome, to customize the view in any way - each observable could be marked in the source code and additional information could be displayed to the user. Reverse of what is implemented now -> abstract with code info, would be code with abstract info. But this would move the focus from the abstract to the code.
		% con: 
			% custom solution which takes tremendous effort to implement, because there is nothing available that fullfills every requirement and for a fully customizeable solution it would effectively be a lightweight IDE.
			% still requires the user to leave the abstract representation and loose foucs
			% cumbersome to examine a set of nodes that share a dependency or are directly related in the abstract graph but are not in close proximity in the JavaScript source code.
	% using a mirror
		% instead of instrumenting the source code used at runtime, use a copy of the website that is instrumented and mirror all interaction from the original to the instrumented version. This would enable the option to navigate to the real source code used at runtime when a node is selected for inspection, since the used code is no longer instrumented.
		% pro: 
			% this would enable all features of chrome to be used a runtime like normal breakpoints, eval in code, syntax highlighting, watches.
		% con: 
			% not easy to record and replay all interactions in realtime if at all - many interactions the user can do to a website are restricted to the acual user due to important security restrictions. E.g. context menu interactions or clipboard access is restricted. In addition some types of ui interactions like mouse movement or drag and drop are hard to record and replay rebustly enough while still keeping performance
			% the mirror needs to match exactly - same resolution due to media queries and other resolution dependent code. If some size calculation is done via JavaScript everything has to be calculated equally. This is nearly impossible to achieve precise enough due to rounding errors.
			% timing is the killing factor here. The replay on the mirror has to match exactly in regards to timing, if not the values of observables and results of calculations based on the system time will turn out differently. This issue might be solveable by replacing some APIs with custom copies that slows down the system enough to enable CRI to mirror the steps in the same time frame. E.g. a mousemove event fires multiple times in fixed intervals if the user moves the mouse - the mirrors observables that use mousemove would have to contain the exact same number of values at any given time to remove synchronicity issues for arbitrary applications.
			% access to Chrome API would have to be intercepted and directed to a fake API - otherwise calls with sideeffects will execute twice. Requests to e.g. WebAPIs might trigger abuse detection because they have to be executed in a very short period of time. This could be solved by intercepting everything that targets an outside element and just fetching the result instead of actually executing them twice, but this will change timing of calls if they are not forced to be synchronized between the mirror and the real application.
			% twice the resources needed
	% Source Code Tooltips
		% - use tooltip that opens when CTRL is hold down on node that displays a snippet of the original code that contains the code corresponding to a node with surrounding lines of code. Or use CTRL click to open the snippet.
		% details in "Implemented Solution"
		%TODO: make sure there are not duplicates in Implemented Solution.
		% Pro: - precise highlighting of corresponding code possible
			% - serves as additional details for nodes, can help identify a node that has no name
			% - helps the user to find and remember a node without a name between multiple uses of the extension by other means than the id. The id may have changed due to changes to the previously executed code.
			% - fast to open/close and without leaving the extensions UI
		% Con: - if the chain of functions is to large, not all relevant code can be shown and in general big chains are hard to read.
			% - no search or other code inspection tools available for the code snippet -> the user would have to use an external tool and the line number for that. No breakpoints, though there are not that useful in reactive programming anyway as described in #state of the art chapter.
			% - can not use existing syntax highlighting of chrome or an IDE. Implementing a own syntax highlighting would not be easy, because if just the small snippet is analysed all context relying highlighting will be lost. Basic keywords would be possible but with own implementation or third party library.
			% full code is not availabe for the user
			% the displayed code can not be examined with features like search - but they are short enough to be examined in a few seconds.
			
	\subsection{Implemented Solution - Source Code Tooltips}
	% display the origin  JS code of a node 
	% change tooltip to show the code if ctrl pressed while mouse enter or when already on element to speed up inspection of multiple nodes one after another
		% limited capabilities of used jalangi -> developed for a special demo, not in general (mentioned in state of the art)
		% jalangi extension via shallow copy
		% tipsy.js - switching out the tooltip with the function
		% link source to specific js file
		% for developers: find instrumented file - added sourcemap
	- when hovering above node press ctrl to view source code (canvas needs to have tabindex to be focusable)
	- nodes have faded border if they do not have source information. names nodes always have source information
	- bind special keypress event for hovered node to canvas
	- remove handlers when leaving
	- add functional title for tipsy tooltips
	- Connection of abstract graph to code is not always helpful, because it takes/tuggs the user back to sequential/non-reactive thinking, but helps to understand nodes without other details or inexpressive names. Without this additional info the user is encouraged to split chained function calls and give each step a named variable, which not only is cumbersome but also may lead to diverting the focus from variables that should really have a name - also falls back to modifying the original source code to enable debugging like in do-debugging.
	
	- the problem is to have the filename in the write function, because all instrumented files use the same jalangi sandbox.
	- the filenames in contrast to the original jalangi are not implemented in the minified non nodejs version taken from the demo page.
	- the only solution with minimal changes to the used jalangi-framework.js is to locally overwrite the W function in every instrumented file. Otherwise the whole instrumentation process would have to be customized.
	- the overwrite is done via shallow copying the J\$ object and replacing the W function with one that submits the filename as a fixed parameter to the analysis and calls the base.
	- to get additional info on observables previously not covered, the invokeFun was also extended with the filename and used to record source info. This can obviously not record names for additional nodes.
	- inline scripts are excluded from this because there might be many and that could lead to performance issues due to the shallow copying.
	If filename is not set, document domain is assumed for the filename.
	
	
		\subsubsection{Strengths and limitations of this approach} 
		% ui, syntax highlighting: syntax highlighting is hard for snippets because the context is missing
		% usefullness of code preview beyond a certain extend: 
			% Chained calls can be to long to display
			% it is nearly useless if the corresponding code is just a function that returns the observable because in contrast to an IDE the developer can not directly jump into the function to look at the acutal code.
			% best in chained calls because the developer can see which part of the chained call corresponds to the observable
			% if the chain is spread out e.g. because parts are assigned to variables the code corresponding to nodes that have a dependency can actually be many lines appart.
		% actual usage in general
		% what it provides and what it doesnt

\section{Rapidly updated Observables}
\label{sec:RapidlyUpdatedObservables}
% value changes often - generates a huge amount of steps
% reasons: timer, mouse, network
% steps can become unexpressive and hard to navigate
% most times the setup is the most important so solved by "pause" - the exception would be additonal observables created later in the execution like e.g. an observable created by a specific event that happens after a set period of time.
% hard to debug interactions that take place after the setup or during a "busy" phase
	
	\subsection{Difficulties and previous approach}
	% previous CRI could not handle well.
	% if the changes originate from anything other than user input - pausing recording is mandatory, 
	%  but continuing leaves gaps in change history that has no visual feedback to the user.
	% lag, getting stuck, crashing chrome due to increasing effort to handle coordination of async actions (async buildup) like message passing and storage access (read/write)
	% basic node exclusion was possible before, but very cumbersome and would exclude the node completely sometimes resuling in errors due to the node missing for dependent actions. A future implementation should only exclude value updates after the first. Should be changed in a way described in detail later.
	
	\subsection{Reworking the graph history}
	% what it is, what it contains: the graph history records every change to the graph as a new step. The previous implementation stored the whole graph for each step inside an array for simplicity. This means the required memory will increase proportianlly with the number of steps.
	% Performance improvements via paging and delta encoding: The idea to use paging was that the memory consumption would be fairly constant and not dependent on the number of steps. It still corresponded to the size of the graph, but since modern systems have a huge amount of RAM this increase would only affect the performance if thousands of nodes were in a graph which would not be possible for the user to comprehend anyway.
	% Paging was then advanced to Delta encoding because it better corresponded to the intention. The changes are the relevant data between steps - loggin the changes and their types actually provides more useful data and makes the changes easier to quey because they do not have to be calculated (in the future the history query feature should be changed to use the graph instead of logging the changes itself). This enabled an easy and more robust way to detect the current change node and later edge - prior the current node was stored inside the node just as the css classes itself and was affected by search highlighting.
	% To reduce the computation cost to reconstruct a full graph for random stepping or stepping back in the history (not all changes can easily be reverted ----- full explanation here) an approach similar to "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_compression_picture_types" without B-frames was implemented. The I frames are called BaseStages, P-frames DeltaStages that only encode the delta to the previous step. The size of the delta window can be configured in code and is currently 100 meaning each BaseStage will have 100 Detlas before a new basestage is created. code in history.js. The history also uses paging by loading several BaseStages at once in a specified window into a cache. This is important to cope with the user stepping forward and backwars repeatedly over a basestage threshold. To increase the cache size also reduces the distinct storage and load commands submitted to the Chrome storage api that is used to store any BaseStage currently not loaded into the cache.
	%TODO ------------- continue here ------
	% -> the saving has to be very fast
	% Memory and CPU for one test case with exactly equal conditions.
	% point out that even this has limitations - see mario example
	
	
	\subsection{"Further work"}
	% before cri3 CPU profiler results
	
	% throttling and debounce UI updates greatly increased performance
	% evaluation of throttle time for Ui changes and reasoning to pick a certain value - compromise between detectable for human and node update speed that can be handled
	% Excluding a node -> limitation: may need to cover many nodes before the ui values are mapped to readable values -> ignore all ancestors option 
	%- should be able to ignore nodes via r-click on node, even with an option to exclude all dependents/dependencies - that did not work because time. It would also help to exclude nodes just form value updates so the nodes is still present in the graph with its value updates.
	% reduce the number of steps by removing node info updates that are not value changes from the history. (only a few, but still) they dont need separate steps when extra info is added
	

\section{Dynamically created observables}
% nodes are generated extensively
% mostly from the same line of code e.g. a loop or created in the local context of a function that is called multiple times
% (local nodes are short living for specific purpose)
% nodes are not identifyable to the user -> cant make connection between similar behaving nodes that could be merged into one node
% -> in case of named nodes the name will appear for each iteration - CRI can not handle decent in History Query and Search yet.
% Userinterface limits - unexpressive nodes, limited canvas
% loosing track of the nodes that matter
% can not be excluded easily

	\subsection{Increased recording complexity}
	% exluding them would require some form of excluding by rule/filter
	% detection for such nodes would be needed to handle them specially. They could be merged into one pseudo node if all outgoing edges have the same target and ingoing edges have the same source.
	% To cope with the special cases, high customization of recording needed so the customization needs to be persistent to be useful
	
\section{CRI - A growing project}
% previous work was strictly focused on the features but now growing project presents issues

	\subsection{Increasing velocity}
	% reorganizing file structure to match placement in chrome devtools vs other posibilities
		% prior to this work there were some files with the window object corresponding to contentscripts in the same directory as files with a window object corresponding to the extensions window.
	% need for more documentation, still far from being fully documented but x new comments
		% CRI3: 271 single line, 48 multiline
		% CRI2: 231 single line, 32 multiline
		% just source of CRI was used to collect results - libraries directory and jalangi-framework excluded. WebStorm/search for // and /* inside the CRI BEta/ CRI directory - usage in comments feature.
		% includes TODOs - more in CRI3,  and commented code - more in CRI2
	% encapsulation and separation of concerns to help track and correct errors or build on existing code
		% closures: a closure prevents variables to be accessed from the outside and makes them effectively private - works because variabels are bound to a function context in javascript. In the example a self executing function is used that returns a function. It is also possible to use closure to create pseudo classes in JS that can be instantiated with "new". A self executing function that returns a constructor function. In CRI we used both in addition to self executing functions that return an object with several functions to realise "public" functions and mimicing the usual behavior of a namespace to not pollute the global namespace and document the correspondence of a public function to a specific feature throug the actual code. 
		
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption={Example of RxJS code.},label={lst:closure}]
			var add = (function () {
			var counter = 0;
			return function () {return counter += 1;}
			})();
		\end{lstlisting}
		
		% CRI3: 19 own js files (excluding jalangi + libraries dir) - 9 new classes
		% not in closure:
		% background-communication -> only script in background context
		% options.js - not needed so far
		% panel.js - not enough time, needs to be split further to achieve separation of concerns.  search and history query feature need to be extracted too. The file should ultimately only be responsible to instanciate the other classes and delegate work. In short of implementing a full MVC or MVVM at least each distinc feature should be in its own file to limit influence to the explicint interfaces.
		% panel-communication.js - no enough time, because the functions and variables are used by code in panel.js
		% CRI2: 8 own js files, no closures, background, devtools, content-script-end are empty
		
		% most other code metrics normally used in OO can not be easily used on JavaScript like cohesion and coupling because it is not type save (is duck typed) makes it hard to detect which variable contains what class at runtime - there can easily be multiple "classes" that get assigned to the same variable, even dynamically so that there is no way to provide consisten results.
	
	% only in appendix because this has 0 value for the reader, but is needed to proove the claim:
	% CRI3 has 3580 total lines of code including comments, brackets, empty lines, just the number of lines per js file; average of 188 lines
	% CRI2: has 2353 total lines, 294 average
	
	\subsection{Build process}
	% (short section)
	% suggested way to exclude files; source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=314360#c10
	% build project	to exclude files from packed extension. like the key or other project files that may contain sensual data.
	% keep in javascript to present familiar environment and language
	% could be used to miniy the extension before deployment in the future
