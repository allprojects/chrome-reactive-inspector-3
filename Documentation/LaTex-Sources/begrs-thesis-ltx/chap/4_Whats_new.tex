\subsection{User-Interface}
	\subsubsection{Considerations}
		% color blindness
		% usage frequency
	\subsubsection{User Tasks}
	% user tasks and what the user needs in each task
	% - statring on a new application or different part of the application, auto reload after instrumented files have changed
	% - just examine the result (hiding of tools)
	% - searching for problems (detect odd behavior, history queries)
	% - checking specific node (e.g. ater trying to fix a problem, find node or dependents)

\subsection{Linking the Source}
	\subsubsection{Problems}
	% Instrumented source code
	
	\subsubsection{Linking Options}
	% Navigating to Source via Chrome debug api
	% using a mirror
	% Source Previews
	
	\subsubsection{Usability} 
	% ui, syntax highlighting
	% usefullness of code preview beyond a certain extend
	% actual usage in general
	% what it provides and what it doesnt
	
\subsection{Busy Applications}
	\subsubsection{Types}
	% - value changes often
		% most times the setup is the most important so solved by "pause"
		% hard to debug interactions that take place after the setup or during a "busy" phase
		% reasons: timer, mouse, network
	% - nodes are generated extensively (often or to many in general)
		% nodes are not identifyable -> cant make connection between similar behaving nodes that could be bundled into one
			% clustering would be needed
		% nodes are short living for specific purpose or belong to concurrent action
	%  - 
	
	\subsubsection{Performance and Limitations}
	% lag, getting stuck, crashing chrome due to async buildup
	% Userinterface limits - unexpressive hard to examine thousands of steps, limited canvas
	% expressivenes of steps or nodes
	
	%TODO add to something: 
	% Excluding a node - what did not work because time.
	% High customization of recording needed so the customization needs to be persistent to be useful
