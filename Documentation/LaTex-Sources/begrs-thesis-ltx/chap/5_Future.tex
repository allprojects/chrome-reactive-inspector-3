% Minimize js and css during release build

% extending tools to work with the graph for big applications
	% magnifying glass
	% multi js file support needs improvements - 

% Solution management

% marking the setps where the recording was paused - because if the recording is continued the gap may lead to 
% wrong assumptions about the changes

% IDE extension like eclipse or webstorm that uses the extension to record data and control the debugger.
 % would enable multi window and toolbar support
 % syntax highlighting (snippets would be directly linkable)
 % would enable use of already existing IDE features
 % con: narrows usability and target users, because it would be no longer portable(depending on IDE)
 	% would have more dependencies and would have to cope with additional required changes due to changes in the IDE after
 	% an update
 	
% ecma6 import support and bundled Rx/Bacon detection, + typescript
	% currently searches for <script Rx.js/Bacon.js>
	% if all used libraries are bundled and only own project files are not
	% will not work
	% all module/file loaders are not supported yet e.g. require.js since module loading prior to ecma6 is a diverse field
	% and most applications use one this is one of the main obstacles before the extension can be used by a wider audience (see temp_references)
	% ecma6 import references file not necessarily in html as <script>
	%TODO check if above is true
	%TODO check if typescript compilatino to un-bundled js is possible
	%possible solution: since scripts are side loaded, append a detection function to the bottom of each loaded javascript file that sends
	% a message to the extension if the "Bacon" or "Rx" object is present.
