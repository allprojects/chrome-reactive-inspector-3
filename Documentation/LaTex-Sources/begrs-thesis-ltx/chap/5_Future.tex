% conclusion and future

% Conclusion:
% - CRI supports many additional features that help to cope with some of the issues encountered by reactive debuggers that are currently not present in RxFiddle.
% - Event though many improvements have been made to cope with large*(always use the same terminology) graphs/histories/applications like performance improvements, it does not cover everything.
% - The UI has been updated to direct the users focus and speed up or reduce cognitive load for some user tasks.
% - To strengthen links* between abstract representation and acutal code, source code previews* have been introduced.
% - CRI has a way to go before being able to properly use in a production environment - Typescript, ecma6 support see future.
% - 

% Future:


% __________________________________________________________ future + issues for github:

% Minimize js and css during release build

% extending tools to work with the graph for big applications
	% magnifying glass
	% multi js file support needs improvements - 

% - The generated steps could be reduced to increase each steps expressiveness.

% Solution management

% marking the setps where the recording was paused - because if the recording is continued the gap may lead to 
% wrong assumptions about the changes

% IDE extension like eclipse or webstorm that uses the extension to record data and control the debugger.
 % would enable multi window and toolbar support
 % syntax highlighting (snippets would be directly linkable)
 % would enable use of already existing IDE features
 % con: narrows usability and target users, because it would be no longer portable(depending on IDE)
 	% would have more dependencies and would have to cope with additional required changes due to changes in the IDE after
 	% an update

% future: extend search with source code line query. Then observabels without a name could be found.
% future: display a visual clue if a history query returns no results.
% future: highlight all results for a history query on the slider.
% future: the variable recording code that is used to ... can not handle multiple variables with the same name! (e.g. in different files or scopes)
 	
% ecma6 import support and bundled Rx/Bacon detection, + typescript
	% currently searches for <script Rx.js/Bacon.js>
	% if all used libraries are bundled and only own project files are not
	% will not work
	% all module/file loaders are not supported yet e.g. require.js since module loading prior to ecma6 is a diverse field
	% and most applications use one this is one of the main obstacles before the extension can be used by a wider audience (see temp_references)
	% ecma6 import references file not necessarily in html as <script>
	%TODO check if above is true
	%TODO check if typescript compilatino to un-bundled js is possible
	%- the breach of the isolated world of chrome context scripts enables the developer to have a total access to the pages javascript which can be used to solve the problem of "import" statements. The developer could overwrite the import/require/.. comands of each known framework and provide a custom function that does the loading in additional 
	% add nodejs support
