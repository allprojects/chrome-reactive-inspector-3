% conclusion and future

% Conclusion:
% - CRI supports many additional features that help to cope with some of the issues encountered by reactive debuggers that are currently not present in RxFiddle.
% - Event though many improvements have been made to cope with large*(always use the same terminology) graphs/histories/applications like performance improvements, it does not cover everything.
% - The UI has been updated to direct the users focus and speed up or reduce cognitive load for some user tasks.
% - To strengthen links* between abstract representation and acutal code, source code previews* have been introduced.
% - CRI has a way to go before being able to properly use in a production environment - Typescript, ecma6 support see future.
% - 

% Future:

% ecma6 import support and bundled Rx/Bacon detection, + typescript
	% currently searches for <script Rx.js/Bacon.js>
	% if all used libraries are bundled and only own project files are not
	% will not work
	% all module/file loaders are not supported yet e.g. require.js since module loading prior to ecma6 is a diverse field
	% and most applications use one this is one of the main obstacles before the extension can be used by a wider audience (see temp_references)
	% ecma6 import references file not necessarily in html as <script>
	%TODO check if above is true
	%TODO check if typescript compilatino to un-bundled js is possible
	%- the breach of the isolated world of chrome context scripts enables the developer to have a total access to the pages javascript 	which can be used to solve the problem of "import" statements. The developer could overwrite the import/require/.. comands of each known framework and provide a custom function that does the loading in additional 
	% add nodejs support
	% - as long as all the files that are desired for debugging are present, it does not matter if they are loaded via a module loader, because the file can be instrumented seperately. The only problem is to find the file, a simple hook in a specially designed comment may be used <!-- cri: src="path to jsfile" --> that is ignored in a production environment. The problem is to access the shared Rx/Bacon object as a simple comment that specifies Rx or Bacon would not suffice.
	
			% instrumenting files via scanning the html for script tags
	% -> will not work for module loaders like require.js or ecma6
	% -> will not work with bundled JavaScript code - but since in development there should be a non bundled version available not 
	%TODO: verify this:
	% a big problem in JavaScript. But for TypeScript since the extension does not support it and when compiling there may already be bundling in place. (#add some text from future here#)
	
	% rapdily updates observables
		% Excluding a node -> limitation:
	% may need to cover many nodes before the ui values are mapped to readable values -> ignore all ancestors option 
	% currently nodes can be excluded via Id in the options page, but this is to cumbersome since the user has to leave the current context, they are specific to one application and should not be in general options.
	%- should be able to ignore nodes via r-click on node, even with an option to exclude all dependents/dependencies - that did not work because time. Ignoring a node completely will sometimes break the dependency graph. Excluded nodes should be created and only value updates beyond the first should be ignored.

% Solution management:
% - enabled storage of project specific configuration. 
% - necessary for fine grained recording to be effective as described in [Increased recording complexity]
