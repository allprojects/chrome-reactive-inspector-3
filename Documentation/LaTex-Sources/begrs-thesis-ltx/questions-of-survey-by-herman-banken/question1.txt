//// First uncomment the next line and hit "Run":
// Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3).map(x => x * 2).subscribe(x => console.log(x))
//// Try to find the numbers in the tool on the right

//// Recomment/remove the previous lines and continue

//// Then uncomment the next line and hit "Stop" then "Run" again:
// Rx.Observable.interval(1000).map(x => x * 2).subscribe(x => console.log(x))
//// See how it is live updating? Hit "Stop" to cancel execution

//// Then uncomment the following lines and hit "Run" again:
// var a = Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3).map(x => x * 2)
// var b = Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)
// a.concat(b).subscribe(x => console.log(x))
// Examine what is shown. In which way is the data combined?
