Question

The example below is a piece of a movie search website. You can enter a movie name and the site looks it up in a database. John - a tester - searches for "The Titanic", however he sees all kinds of other (non relevant) movie results too.
After he's done typing, and all async requests are done, what is the movie at the top of the result list?

Explain what is wrong:

How you would solve this?

Code: 
// Test inputs
// input$ : Rx.Observable<string>
var input$ = survey.imdb.johnsInput$
  .do(x => console.log("input: "+x))
// findMoviesAsync : (query: string) => Rx.Observable<string[]>
var findMoviesAsync = survey.imdb.findMoviesAsync

// Program

input$
  .debounce(50, survey.scheduler)
  .flatMap(q => { return findMoviesAsync(q) })
  .subscribe(list => survey.imdb.render(list))

// Advance time very far into the future
survey.scheduler.advanceTo(1e6)
