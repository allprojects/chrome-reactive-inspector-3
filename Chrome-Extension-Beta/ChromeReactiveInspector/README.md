The manifest declares

 * background/background.js to be loaded in the background once for the whole browser.

 * content/content.js to be loaded once for each tab

 * devtools/devtools.html to be loaded once you open the devtools

   this will start create a panel with the devtools/panel.html
   (maybe this panel exists for each tab the devltools are open, or there is only one for multiple tabs)

 * options/options.html once if you click on chrome-reactive-inspector -> extensions -> options.
